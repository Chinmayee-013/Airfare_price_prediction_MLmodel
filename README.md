Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts airfare prices based on various features like the origin, destination, date, airline, number of stops,and other travel details.
With airfare prices fluctuating frequently, a predictive model can help travelers and travel businesses plan trips more efficiently, providing insights into the best times to book flights and 
helping them make cost-effective decisions.

The objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately forecast the price of airfare tickets.
By analyzing historical data and understanding key factors influencing airfare prices, the model can help predict the price of a flight given certain input features.
